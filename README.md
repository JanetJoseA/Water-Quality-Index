various AI algorithms are assessed to handle WQ data collected over an extended period and develop a dependable approach for forecasting water quality as accurately as possible. 
Specifically, various machine learning classifiers and their stacking ensemble models were used to classify the WQ data via the Water Quality Index (WQI). The classifiers included Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), CATBoost, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The dataset used in the project included 1679 samples and their meta-data collected over nine years.
